# Locate

A simple Java Script program to locate common elements within defined arrays

## Setup

Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/mtrebels/locate.git`

## Operation

`locate.js` contains defined arrays.

These arrays have been hard coded in order to get a minimum viable product (MVP).

`container.html` has been created to run the program within a browser.

## Next Steps

- Allow users to enter arrays
- Setup build script
- Setup unit tests
